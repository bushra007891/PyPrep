# Escape Sequence Characters in Python
'''An escape sequence is a combination of a backslash (\) followed by a character that has a special meaning.'''

# Common Escape Sequences:
# \n (Newline): 
'''Moves the cursor to the next line.'''

# \t (Tab): 
'''Inserts a tab space (similar to pressing the Tab key on the keyboard).'''

# \\ (Backslash): 
'''Inserts a backslash character.'''

# \' (Single Quote): 
'''Inserts a single quote in a string.'''

# \" (Double Quote): 
'''Inserts a double quote in a string.'''

# \r (Carriage Return): 
'''Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line, without advancing to the next line.'''

# \b (Backspace): 
'''Moves the cursor back one space.'''

# \f (Form Feed): 
'''Moves the cursor to the next line and starts at a fixed horizontal position (rarely used).'''
print("Hello\nWorld")   # Adds a newline
print("Python\tis fun") # Adds a tab space
print("She said, \"Hello!\"") # Adds double quotes in the string

# Characteristics of Escape Sequences:
# Begin with a backslash (\): 
'''All escape sequences start with the backslash character, followed by one or more characters that specify the action.'''

# Part of the string: 
'''Even though they perform special actions, escape sequences are still considered part of the string.'''

# Helpful for formatting: 
'''Escape sequences make it easier to format text in Python, such as creating new lines, adding tabs, or including quotes inside strings.'''

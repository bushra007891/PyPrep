# Understanding Comments in Python
'''Comments are lines in the code that Python ignores when it runs the program. Their purpose is to explain or describe what the code is doing.'''

# Comments are very useful when you want to:
'''Explain what your code does.
Leave reminders for yourself or others.
Temporarily disable parts of your code.'''

# Characteristics of Comments
# Not Executed
'''Comments are ignored by Python and do not affect the output of your program.'''

# Improves Readability
'''Comments make your code easier to understand for others or for you when you revisit your code after some time.'''

# Single-Line vs. Multi-Line
'''Use # for short, single-line comments. Use triple quotes (''' '''or """) for longer explanations or multi-line comments.'''

# Debugging Tool
'''You can use comments to temporarily disable a line of code by commenting it out, making it easier to test and debug your program.'''

# Clarification for Complex Code
'''If a part of your code is tricky or complicated, comments can help explain what’s going on so that others (or you) can understand it more easily.'''

# Types of Comments in Python
'''There are two main types of comments in Python:'''

# Single-Line Comments
'''Single-line comments are used to add short notes on a single line.'''
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")

# Multi-Line Comments
'''Sometimes, you need to write longer explanations, which can’t fit into a single line. In this case, you can use multi-line comments.'''
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span across multiple lines.
'''
print("Multi-line comments are useful!")
